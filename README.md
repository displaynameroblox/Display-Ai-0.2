hey, this is my beta code, i have tried but i don't have server hosting, and i wish i can host this ai server for my roblox project. 

don't give up like me, i have put this ai server code for free for ppl like me who is trying to make something cool for fun, i will not try to fix the error any soon maybe in the coming years. i hope you like it!,

how to use:

use /chat (post) to send json to the server (error is: the server replys with the login html)

use /settings (post) for setting the ai itself (not fully working)

use /login (get) to login to the mod Dashboard, you can ban users who is talking bad (like: nsfw, love etc )

also use Pollinations AI (https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations) you can put your own AI or use apis like openAI or gamini

note: this was for a roblox game and not a website

note2: this is not a fully working code, i have tried my best to make it work but i don't have server hosting so i can't test it out, if you want to make it work you can try to fix the errors and make it work, i will not try to fix the error any soon maybe in the coming years. i hope you like it!

also if you somehow got it working i would like if you send me a video of it working, i would be really happy! X.com @itz_Displayname

this would be updated soon
